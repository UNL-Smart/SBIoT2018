We're very excited - not just because of the inordinate amount of caffeine based products consumed -
but also because our team are putting together the final missing parts in Omaha - [SBIT2018 Workshop](https://unl-smart.github.io/SBIT2018).

So should you also be excited? Well yes... and here's why!

* **Attendance**: we're expecting over 20+ attendees
* **Date**: 9 of November 2018
* **Venue**: Scott conference center
* **Speakers**: we're in the process of finalizing the list of speakers

but we've already secured a first batch of experts:

* **Dr.	David	Lehrer** - https://www.cbe.berkeley.edu/aboutus/staff-edward.htm<br>
* **Dr. Ralph Muehleisen** - https://www.anl.gov/contributors/ralph-t-muehleisen<br>
