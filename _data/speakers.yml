  title: "Professor • RASEI Associate Director • Charles Victor Schelke Endowed Chair • Professional Engineer (PE)"
  bio: "<p>I am a professor of architectural engineering in the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Architectural Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. At the undergraduate level, the architectural engineering programs aims at educating engineers to design high-performance commercial buildings such as offices, schools, hospitals, and industrial facilities. At the graduate level, our building systems engineering program investigates emerging trends and issues revolving around low-energy high performance building design concepts, renewable energy solutions applied to buildings, and novel approaches to building control and performance analysis.</p><p>My research emphasizes model-based predictive optimal control and model-free reinforcement learning control of building energy systems and building thermal mass, model-based benchmarking of building operational performance, whole-building fault detection and diagnosis, control strategies for mixed-mode buildings that incorporate both natural and mechanical ventilation, uncertainty quantification of occupant behavior and its impact, energy analytics and decision analysis as well as the integration of building energy system operations with the electric grid system.</p>"
